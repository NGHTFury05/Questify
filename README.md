# Inter Prep
 A perparation Assistant
This works using the groq api keys and uses the llama 3.3 7b versatile model
It uses the yutube api to generate the relevant youtube video results
Used some plotting stuff to track the progress of the user
Could use a database to Track the progress on the long run
It works perfectly well for a single sitting
